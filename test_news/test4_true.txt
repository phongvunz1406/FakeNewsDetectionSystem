  "fullText_based_content": "U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-3rd, was not pleased with the debt limit deal that became law earlier this month. He said the measure will lead to deep cuts to programs that help needy families, students and seniors while keeping George W. Bush-era tax cuts that benefit the middle-class and wealthy. Scott has long called for ending the tax reductions. \"The estimated savings of this deal only pay for half of the cost of extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts for another decade,\" Scott said in an Aug. 1 news release. The deal passed by Congress expanded the nation’s debt limit to $16.4 trillion—a $2.1 trillion increase. The measure requires Congress to cut $2.4 trillion out of the budget over the next 10 years. It calls for $900 billion in cuts up front and assigns a bipartisan panel to find another $1.5 trillion. If the committee fails, a trigger enacts $1.2 trillion in cuts to domestic and defense spending. So the total reduction would be at least $2.1 trillion and could be as much as $2.4 trillion. Scott said he used the $2.1 trillion figure in his comparison of spending reductions to the 10-year cost of extending the Bush tax cuts. The CBO reports that keeping the tax cuts through 2020 costs $3.9 trillion, with $3.3 trillion from lost revenues and interest payments, and $600 billion from adjustments to the Alternative Minimum Tax. Analysts agree it’s legitimate to include AMT-related costs. Therefore, the $2.1 trillion in debt deal savings equals about 54 percent of the $3.9 trillion cost of extending the Bush tax cuts.",
