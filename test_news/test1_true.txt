Jon Kyl of Arizona said he thought a filibuster was unlikely but he wasn't taking it entirely off the table.\nObama did join a broader Democratic effort to filibuster Alito.\nBut in his own words, he said it was not the best strategy.\nLater that day, an AP report carried the headline, 'Sen. Obama Criticizes Filibuster Tactic.'",
